Assignment: Third Homework 
*/

I have one folder with 2 folder insides. There is bin and src. I have all my .java files, makefile, and readme.txt in src folder. I wrote command of "make". This made me "javac Examtester.java". Then, I wrote command of "java Examtester".This showed my output of the homework. The output starts with giving 10 questions. The first five is MCQuestions and the other five Questions are SAQuestions. Then it tells me to enter a negative number or the positive number. The negative will reorder Questions and Ans. The positive will reorder specific one. The for example, if I do negative input, it will give the shuffle questions and then it will tell me to input specific input for the MC Answer or SA answer. The output will look like this. It has many classes, it take the user input and stores it also it checks the ans with student input and then give the score. My restore answer was not working so I just print it.
